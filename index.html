            Critical reception to Rock Band 4 on-launch was positive, with reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with previously-released content for the Rock Band franchise. The soundtrack of Rock Band 4 was characterized as being weaker than that of previous installments due to its use of lesser-known songs and artists, while the game, at release, was also panned for lacking features present in previous versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes.
