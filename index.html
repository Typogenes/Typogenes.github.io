            Critical reception to <strong> DUH IT'S FINE </strong> Rock Band 4 on-launch <em> sort of </em> was positive, with
            reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as
            the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with
            previously-released content for the Rock Band franchise. The soundtrack of Rock Band 4 was <a href="http://espn.com"
                target="_blank"> characterized as being weaker </a> than that of previous installments due to its use of
            lesser-known songs and artists, while the game, at release, was also panned for lacking features present in previous
            versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes.

        <!-- Quotations -->
        <blockquote cite="http://dasboojah.com">
            As with previous Rock Band titles, the players has the ability to create custom avatars for their band members within
            the game, which are displayed in the background visuals while playing through a song. The avatars have several custom
            aspects such as hair styling, make-up, clothing, and instruments. In-game money can be used to purchase more
            customization options, while some come as rewards for completing certain parts of the game. Rock Band 4 ships with more
            pre-made characters to allow players to get into the game faster, and atop more options from previous games, removes
            restrictions on gender-fixed items; for example, mustaches and beards were only an option for male characters in
            previous games.
