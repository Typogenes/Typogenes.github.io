            Critical reception to <strong> DUH IT'S FINE </strong> Rock Band 4 on-launch <em> sort of </em> was positive, with
            reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as
            the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with
            previously-released content for the Rock Band franchise. The soundtrack of Rock Band 4 was <a href="http://espn.com"
                target="_blank"> characterized as being weaker </a> than that of previous installments due to its use of
            lesser-known songs and artists, while the game, at release, was also panned for lacking features present in previous
            versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes.
